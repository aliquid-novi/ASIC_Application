# ASIC_Application
This repo contains a monte-carlo simulation of insider trades being detected by an Isolation Forest and it's associated report in addition to a Critical Review of the application of ML in HFT and it's relevance to ASIC. 

For context, upon finding out that ASIC was hiring for a Market Analyst role, specific to the OTC Markets, I immediately went to work on the Isolation Forest Detection project. In regards to the Critical Review, I had written the paper in my first semester of my Masters of Math and Quantitative Finance. After further research and re-establishing my regulatory knowledge that was obtained in my Graduate Certificate of Applied Finance, I recommend approaches in both reports.
